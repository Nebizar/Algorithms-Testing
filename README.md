#Algorithms-Testing

All the code in this repository was created as Student Projects for Algorithms and Data Structures.
Includes various sorting methods both simple (e.g. SelectionSort, InsertionSort, BubbleSort) and more advanced (HeapSort, QuickSort, CountSort).
Another folder contains Searchning methods in tables and BST structures, different graphs representations and finding both Euler's and Hamilton's cycles.
Final folder consists different solutions for Knapsack Packing Problem. Each folder contains report about conducted experiment.

## Getting started

The code is rather big and contains specialized algorithm testing functions for given task on University.

### Prerequisities

Any C++ compiler.
